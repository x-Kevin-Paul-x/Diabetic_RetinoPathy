# Classification Loss Configuration
# Alternative approach with Focal Loss for class imbalance

name: classification

# Primary loss function
primary:
  type: focal  # Options: cross_entropy, focal, weighted_ce
  
# Focal Loss settings (for handling class imbalance)
focal:
  alpha: null  # Per-class weights, null for balanced
  gamma: 2.0  # Focusing parameter (higher = more focus on hard examples)
  reduction: mean
  label_smoothing: 0.1

# Cross Entropy settings
cross_entropy:
  weight: null  # Will be set from dataset.class_weights
  label_smoothing: 0.1
  reduction: mean

# Weighted Cross Entropy
weighted_ce:
  use_dataset_weights: true  # Use weights from dataset config
  reduction: mean

# Auxiliary losses
auxiliary:
  use_regression_aux: false  # Add MSE loss for ordinal consistency
  regression_weight: 0.2

# Threshold optimization (not typically needed for classification)
threshold_optimization:
  enabled: false
